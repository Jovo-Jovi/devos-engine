# Changelog

The notable changes of each DEV_OS Engine release. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-26

The first public release.

### Setup

- `devos init` takes an empty folder to a GitHub repository that AI agents build, review and ship task by task, from
  the terminal or from a guided page in the browser (`devos ui`).
- The contract, version 1, is shown in full and accepted before anything is written or sent.
- Sixteen project types and twenty stacks, each with its own checks, first-task scaffold and module providers.
- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex or Gemini as the reviewer and the builders, with any model their tool offers.
- Keys are typed once and handed straight to GitHub secrets. DEV_OS never stores one.
- `devos upgrade` proposes a new engine version as a pull request; `devos verify` and `devos watch` say what stands
  between a computer and a green first run.

### The method it installs

- The automated cycle on GitHub Actions: fence, build, checks, review, verdict, human gates, merge and deploy.
- Guards, the UI/UX gate, the security and test gates, a skills catalogue with 18 vendored skills, and the usage
  record of every agent run.

### The Control Tower link

- Linking a project to the private DEV_OS Control Tower is optional and asked as a plain yes or no at setup. Nothing
  is sent without a yes, and the engine works the same either way.
- Before you answer, the contract says what the Control Tower keeps, why, for how long and where, and how to reach its
  operator to see, correct or delete it.

### Licences

- The engine is under PolyForm Shield 1.0.0, the files it installs into a project under MIT, and the third-party files
  under their own licences (`LICENSES.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`).

## Before 1.0.0

Versions 0.1.0 to 0.3.0 were private pre-releases.
